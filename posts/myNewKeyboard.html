No, this is something called a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Doomhammer-Choc-87-Mechanical-Keyboard/dp/B07PBYQ56Z">Doomhammer Choc87</a>, a cheap Chinese keyboard that has Brown switches. After typing on blues for two years, I was tired of their noise and wanted something with tactile feedback that was also quiet. After optimizing for tactility, cost, and quietness, I settled for Brown switches.</p><p>And I've got to say, this is a very nice typing experience. The board is rock solid and sounds great while typing. Gone are the sharp clicks of Blues replaced by the mellow, deep thuds of Browns.</p><p>For the key nerds out there, it comes with Outemu box brown switches.</p><p>I messed around with settings and I finally understand how to use the function keys. There is a way I can choose which keys to light up for custom lighting profiles which seems like a cool feature and I'll see if it's actually useful.</p><p>The cable is braided and while it's an annoying bright orange, it feels good and is long enough to reach behind my keyboard. I can't complain for the price.</p><p>My biggest complaint is how hard it is to remove the plastic cover on top and around the board. I tried looking for a disassembly video online but the keyboard isn't popular enough to have a video. I'll eventually work up the courage to pry the cover off, but I'm too afraid of breaking it to try right now.</p><p><strong>In summary</strong>: If you are looking for a solid and quiet mechanical keyboard for an excellent price, consider the Doomhammer Choc 87.</p></div></body></html>
