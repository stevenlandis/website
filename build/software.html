<p>Including my own. I hate using other people's libraries because I'm lazy. I always want to do something that their library doesn't support and that's when I give up.</p>

<p>I have a new philosophy towards writing software. By providing basic building blocks for developers, I let them write their own libraries instead of forcing them to use my library.</p>

<p>All software involves restricting what a developer can do. Some examples include <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> which forces developers to write heirarchical UIs and <a href="https://redux.js.org">Redux</a> which forces developers to never modify data structures in place.</p>

<p>For the most part, the two above libraries require restrictions that don't chafe too much and that is the sign of a good library. Those developers have spent a lot of time thinking about use cases and determinted that the above restrictions don't stop other developers from expressing their ideas.</p>

<p>Writing a library is in a way making a language. Of course, software is always written in a language, but in a larger sense, defining functions and classes is a way of creating a more specific language.</p>
