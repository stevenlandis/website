				<h2 class="bodyheader">Apple Butter</h2>
				<div class="body">
					<p>Use well-flavored apples--Cortlands, Macintosh--or a mixture.  Eat one or two before you begin because apples vary in taste and sweetness.</p><p>You can make a small batch of this, but it always seems to come out right, so make a large quantity to start with.  Maybe I say that because I eat apple butter like most people eat applesauce.  Your dad used to say I ate toast with my apple butter.</p><p>Start with a half bushel of apples.  Wash them and cut them into quarters.  If you use a Foley mill, you do not have to remove stems, peel, or cores.  (A Foley mill is a useful kitchen tool.  It extrudes pulp and leaves the dregs behind.)</p><p>Place the apple quarters in a large porcelain or other non-aluminum pot over low heat until the apples juice a bit.  Simmer slowly until the apples are soft and mushy.  Stir frequently-apples tend to stick and then scorch.</p><p>Put the cooked apples through the Foley mill in batches.  Throw the skins, seeds, and stems on the compost pile.</p><p>Turn the apple puree into a large bowl.  In another bowl, measure 1/4 to 1/2 cups sugar for each cup of puree.  I always start with the lesser amount of sugar.</p><p>To the sugar, stir in the following:</p><p class="body-indent">6 teaspoons cinnamon</p><p class="body-indent">3 teaspoons ground cloves</p><p class="body-indent">1 teaspoon ground allspice</p><p>Add the sugar/spice mixture to the puree and blend well.  Taste it.  It will taste raw, but it should have a definite spicy taste.  Add sugar and spices as needed, but keep the same proportion of spices.</p><p>You can return the seasoned puree to a large pot and cook down over low heat on top of the stove.  However, we put the puree in a large, non-aluminum roaster and bake it in a 300ยบ oven for several hours.  Either way, cook until the apple butter thickens, browns, and bubbles throughout.  Stir occasionally.</p><p>You can cook the puree in batches if you don't have a large roaster.  You can also add reserved puree as the quantity shrinks somewhat as it cooks.</p><p>While the apple butter cooks down, sterilize jars.  I generally use peanut butter or pasta sauce jars as they are large and the non-plastic lids seal well.  Boil them in a large container like a Dutch oven for at least five minutes.</p><p>To fill the jars, have ready tongs, a large-mouth funnel if possible, a long-handled ladle, hot pads, and soup bowl.  Rinse the tools in hot water.</p><p>Use the tongs to put a drained, sterile jar on a cooling rack.  Place the funnel in the jar, and ladle in hot apple butter, filling the jar to within 1/2 inch of the top.  If needed, wipe the top with a damp paper towel.  It must be clean for a good seal.</p><p>With the tongs, remove a hot, wet lid from the sterilizing bath and place it on the jar.  Tighten fully.  </p><p>Repeat the process until all the apple butter is preserved.  Pour excess into the soup bowl and refrigerate after it is cooled.  It's ready for breakfast.</p><p>When the jars are cooled, store them in a dark, cool spot.</p>
