					<p>Mrs. Martin</p><p> </p><p>The Martins lived next door when I was a little girl.  They had two daughters.  Teresa was a little older than I, and Betty Anne was several years younger.  They also had a living room full of rocking chairs, a huge lilac in the back yard, and a gleaming kitchen.  One day Mrs. Martin told me how she kept it so spotless.  "Every time I spill something, I just take a paper towel--like this--and wipe it right up.  This stove looks like the day Abe and I bought it."  And it did.  I loved her banana bread when I was a girl, and it has continued to be a family favorite.</p><p> </p><p class="body-indent">2/3 cup sugar</p><p class="body-indent">1/3 cups soft shortening</p><p class="body-indent">2 eggs</p><p class="body-indent">3 tablespoons sour milk</p><p class="body-indent">1 cup mashed bananas</p><p class="body-indent">2 cups sifted flour</p><p class="body-indent">1 teaspoon baking powder</p><p class="body-indent">1/2 teaspoon soda</p><p class="body-indent">1/2 teaspoon salt</p><p class="body-indent">1/2 cup chopped nuts</p><p> </p><p>Stir 1/2 teaspoon vinegar or lemon juice into 3 tablespoons milk and set it aside. </p><p> </p><p>Preheat oven to 350Â°.  Cream sugar and shortening until fluffy.  Add two eggs and beat until well mixed.  Stir mashed bananas into the mixture.</p><p> </p><p>Measure the flour into a bowl.  Stir in the baking powder, soda, and salt.  Add the dry ingredients to the banana mixture, alternating with the sour milk.  Stir in chopped nuts.</p><p> </p><p>You can also make start this in a food processor where you can mix the sugar, shortening, eggs, and bananas before removing and adding dry ingredients.</p><p> </p><p>Pour into one greased loaf pan and bake 50 to 60 minutes.</p><p> </p><p>Test to see if it is done by piercing the middle with a piece of spaghetti.  If it comes out clean, the bread is ready to remove from the oven.</p><p> </p><p>Gently shake it from its pan onto a cooling rack.</p>
