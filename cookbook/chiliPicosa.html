					<p>The Governor of Texas via Jack McDonald</p><p>Jack reports this is the real Texas salsa.</p><p class="body-indent">15 Jalapeno peppers</p><p class="body-indent">1/2 teaspoon salt</p><p class="body-indent">1 tablespoon or juice of 1/2 lemon</p><p class="body-indent">1 clove garlic, peeled</p><p class="body-indent">2 cans whole tomatoes</p><p class="body-indent">1 teaspoon oil</p><p>Heat pan of water to boil.  Add the whole green jalapeno peppers and boil until they become olive drab in color.  Remove and drain and allow to cool enough to be handled.  Cut off the stems and remove the seeds and large membrane.  If you want it hotter, leave the seeds in.</p><p>Put the peppers, salt, and lemon juice in a blender and puree to a paste.</p><p>In a food grinder (not a blender) grind the tomatoes and then add the pepper paste and the oil and mix but not puree.  Jack suggests adding about a tablespoon of dried onion flakes at this point also.</p><p>When the salsa is the right consistency, taste test for seasoning.  Remember, it might be a bit raw in flavor.  The salsa really needs a few hours to allow the flavors to meld.</p><p>When the salsa is mixed, bottle it in airtight jars and refrigerate.  I've had even better success in preserving the salsa by freezing it in ice cube trays and then bagging the cubes after they are frozen.  This method is also very handy for usage, because you only thaw what you are going to use.</p><p>Serve on top of most anything.</p>
