        <h2>Why does text rendering suck?</h2>
        <p>Why is it so hard to render text? The answer is that it is a pain in the ass to measure text. It is very rare that a graphics API exposes tools to measure individual characters. And it isn't even that hard. The tool can give character dimmensions as a bounding box and developers can use that to position and center text.</p>

        <p>Libraries nowadays don't give developers enough control. They assume the developers doesn't know how to write code. Sometimes this makes it easy to quickly create things, but often the creativity of the developer is limited by the tools at their disposal. Like graphics APIs not exposing character measurements. It seems like a basic requirement for positioning text and yet toolboxes fail to expose that behavior.</p>
