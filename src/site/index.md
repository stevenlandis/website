# Welcome!

I just graduated from UCSB! I like coding as a hobby and I made this site from scratch by hand-assembling the bytes. I made a python library to help with the process I'm calling [bld](posts/bld).

If you want to make fractals, check out my [fractal generator](fractal). It's a generalization of the dragon curve that leads to some pretty cool shapes.

I also have a password-protected portion of my website. Use the [landing page](secret) to access it or read more about it in [this post](posts/secretSideToMyStaticSite).
