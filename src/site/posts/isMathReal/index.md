# Is math real?

Is math something that exists, or is it something we discover?

In short, math is completely made-up. Math is the art of asserting a few base axioms to be true, and then using those base rules to make new rules.

But math is real! We can use it to make predictions about the world. We can use it as a modeling tool to discover things we never would have discovered!

If you're asking why 1 + 2 = 3, you're looking at math the wrong way. At it core, each mathematical system has a set of rules and those rules are completely made up. We define sets of numbers. Nobody has to prove that 1 + 2 = 3, we assert it is true and move on.

No mathematical system can be proved consistent without a more powerful system.

So that's the truthiness of math, but that doesn't address the usefulness of math. Because it is incredibly useful. And the idea of applying math to solve a real-world problem can get pretty abstract. In fact, we use math in everyday life.

The real world is very complicated. Too complicated for our feeble human brains to understand it all. So we approximate. We find patterns in the chaos that are much easier to understand. And understanding something means we can predict it, and predicting something means we can control it. That's power.

This is math. Math is the process of finding patterns, and using those patterns to predict the world. Over time, we've managed to find similarities between different patterns and merged them together.

When patterns stop being useful, we develop new patterns to explain different sides of the chaos. When we needed to count discreet things, we made integers. When we needed to divide things like land into smaller parcels, we made fractions. When we wanted to measure the area of a circle, we made irrational numbers. When we wanted to think about the dynamics of planets, we made calculus. When we wanted to formalize computation itself and move computation out of the mind, we made discreete math.

So somehow math is completely made-up, and at the same time, it's exceptionally good at predicting how the world works. That's the real paradox.

There's a wonderful dance between math and physics. Physics will make a surprising observation, like the patterns that light makes when it shines through two small holes. Then math will develop whole new fields to explain these strange phenomena. Sometimes, a beatiful thing happens when the math not only manages to explain the phenomena, but also predicts new phemomena that can be tested. And the cycle continues.

Computer science just had it's first upset in this department with quantum computers which challenge the traditional Turing machines. I'm not sure exactly how quantum computers work, but I do know that they can perform some tasks in polynomial time that take Turing machines exponential time which challenges some encryption algorithms like RSA that depends on integer-factorization being a really hard problem to solve. Theoretically, if someone had a device that could break quantum computing, they could spy on virtually any encrypted payload sent over https without any party knowing. Which is a little troubling.
