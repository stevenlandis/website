# Welcome!

I'm going into my senior year as a Computer Engineer at UCSB and I code as a hobby. I built this site from scratch which means I wrote a python library I'm calling [bld](posts/bld.html) to generate this static website.

My gamble is that learning *how* to solve problems is more important than learning notable solutions to problems. Like, I'd rather try to make my own sorting algorithm than learn Quicksort. That being said, Quicksort is really useful and I know I won't come up with a better algorithm without a lot of effort. Everything in moderation.

If you want to make fractals, check out my [fractal generator](fractalGenerator/fractal.html). It's a generalization of the dragon curve.
