# Welcome!

I'm going into my senior year as a Computer Engineer at UCSB and I code as a hobby. I built this site from scratch which means I wrote a python library I'm calling [bld](posts/bld.html) to generate this static website.

Rather than use other people's libraries, I prefer writing my own libraries and often re-invent the wheel. Here's a link to learn more about my [approach to writing software](posts/software.html).
