## All Software Sucks

Including my own. I hate using other people's libraries because I'm lazy. I always want to do something that their library doesn't support and that's when I give up.

I have a new philosophy towards writing software. By providing basic building blocks for developers, I let them write their own libraries instead of forcing them to use my library.

All software involves restricting what a developer can do. Some examples include [React](https://reactjs.org/) which forces developers to write heirarchical UIs and [Redux](https://redux.js.org) which forces developers to never modify data structures in place.

For the most part, the two above libraries require restrictions that don't chafe too much and that is the sign of a good library. Those developers have spent a lot of time thinking about use cases and determinted that the above restrictions don't stop other developers from expressing their ideas.

Writing a library is in a way making a language. Of course, software is always written in a language, but in a larger sense, defining functions and classes is a way of creating a more specific language.
